# Zomato-EDA

We have taken ZOMATO data sets as an example through which we have predicted many results by looking at previous data sets. By the help of graphs, pivot tables, heatmaps, box plots etc. we have tried to analyze the data and understand patterns to find interesting relations among variables.
